# Basic React Bootstrap Structure
Tried to create a minimal set up for a React Bootstrap application which uses a Browserify CommonJS module structure....which is nice.

Do an:

<code>npm install</code>

Browserify the shit out of with with:

<code>browserify -t [ babelify --presets [ react ] ] client/js/*.js -o build/bundle.js</code>

browse the index page...nice! :-)
